# [Code Aquatics](https://code-aquatics.herokuapp.com/)
![Responsiveness](readme_files/images/amiresponsive.PNG)

The main purpose of this project is to create an ecommerce website where users can purchase aquarium related items. This website was made with the begginers aquarists in mind, here they can find a curated selection of products ideal for begginers and some useful information in a blog.
This website is my forth and last milestone project for the diploma in software development from the [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net). 
A live view of this website can be found here: [Code Aquatics](https://code-aquatics.herokuapp.com/).
